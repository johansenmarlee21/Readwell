      booksynopsis: 'Conceal Your Intentions\nKeep People off balance and in the dark by never revealing the purpose behind your actions. If they have no clue what you are up to, they cannot prepare a defence. Guide them far enough down the wrong path, envelop them in enough smoke, and by the time they realize your intentions, it will be too late.\n\nAlways Say Less Than Necessary\nWhen you are trying to impress people with words, the more you say, the more common you appear, and the less in control. Powerful people impress and intimidate by saying less. The more you say, the more likely you are to say something foolish. Choose your victims and opponents carefully, then never offend or deceive the wrong person.\n\nUse Absence\nIf you alreadu established in a group, temporary withdrawl from it will make you more talkded about, even more admired. You must learn when to leave. Create value through scarcity.',

      booksynopsis: 'Less Ego, More Wealth\nSaving money is the gap between your ego and your income, and wealth is what you do not see. So wealth is created by suppressing waht you could buy today in order to more stuff or more options in the future.\n\nManage your money in a way that helps you sleep at night.\nSome people will sleep well unless they are earning the highest returns, others will only get a good rest if the are conservatively invested to each of their own.\n\nIncrease your time horizon\nTime is the most powerful force in investing. It makes little things grow and big mistakes fade away. it cannot neutralize luck and risk, but it pushes results closer towards what people deserve.\n\nBecome OK with things going wrong.\nYou can be wrong half the time and still make a fortune, because a small minority of things accounts for the majority of outcomes. It is fine to have a large cunk of poor investments and a few outstandng ones.',

      booksynopsis: 'Fear and Greed\nPeople\'s lives are forever controlled by two emotions - fear and greed. while fulfilling our greed we often opt for a job to earn plenty of money, which is eventually a short term solution to a long term problem.\nit is just like the picture of a donkey dragging a cart with its owner dangling a carrot just in front of its nose. The donkey\'s ownermay be going where he wants to, but the donkehy is chasing an llusiong. Tomorrow there will only be another carrot for the donkey.\n\nThe Way Life Teaches\nThe way our lives are meant to teach us, is something different from the methods of our schools. it is beyond that. Life does not teaches in lectures. Life will not lecture us to make us understand what to do and what not to do. Life will push and punches us in the face to make us learn something. If we learn what life is trying to say, we would grow. If not, life will somehow put us again in the same condition.',
